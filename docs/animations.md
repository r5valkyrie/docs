## 1. What are animations?

Animations are sequences of frames (snapshots) in which the model is posed in various ways. Titanfall and Apex Legends animations were created at 30 FPS (frames per second). Hence, animations are collections of key frames and frame transitions spread across time. 

## 2. What is a rig?

A rig / skeleton / armature is a collection of "bones" mapped onto vertex groups contained within the model's mesh (collection of triangles / polygons), in order to be able to move it and control its movements

Animation has two prerequisite steps: skinning and rigging

Skinning, in this context, does not refer to texturing or retexturing a model, but to mapping bones to a model's vertices / vertex groups in order to create a skeleton.

Rigging encompasses weight painting and the manipulation of bones with bone controllers, inverse kinematics, etc.

The armature of a model can be seen by exporting the RMDL with RSX as SMDs (Studiomodel Data Files) and then importing them into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), using [Blender Source Tools] (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Blender_Source_Tools) on .qc / .smd import mode.

R1 (Titanfall 2014) and R2 (Titanfall 2, 2016) require extracting the .MDL files from the VPK archives (before RPAK archives existed) and then decompiling them with Studiomdl.exe, to obtain a .qc and .SMD files. They can be imported into Blender, afterwards, using the Blender Source Tools.

It is important to note that animation-only .MDL's exist. These .MDL's are usually used for shared animations that can be played by multiple different models. Animation-only .qc's also exist, alongside .qci files (.qc inherited / included).

Bones are exposed by going into "Edit Mode". From that view it is possible to observe bones, joints, bone modifiers, the bone hierarchy, etc.

Changes in position of bones between frames are known as "deltas" (differences / changes) and animations obtained from subtracting frames or animations from other animations are known as "delta animations". These "delta anims" are meant to be layered on top of other animations, as they do not have meaning on their own.

Delta layering does not completely override bone positions to the delta, but, instead, compounds the core animations with the delta animations.

Delta animations are used to combine / blend between different animations / animation states such as firing with aiming down sights, etc.


## 3. A brief historical recap of Respawn's animation implementation

Respawn's first title, Titanfall (2014), essentially used Valve's entire Source Engine tech stack, with modifications, meaning:  
```
- VPK (Valve Pack archive, replacing GCF's, Gazelle Cache Files, which were named after Steam's old internal name, Gazelle)
- SMD (Studiomodel Data)
- VTX (Valve's proprietary mesh strip format)
- VVD (Valve Studiomodel Vertex Data File, storing positio n independent data for bone weights, normals, vertices, tangents and texture coordinates for UV Mapping, used by the MDL)
- MDL (Valve Model)
- PHY (Valve Physics)
- VGUI (Valve Graphical User Interface)
- VGUI Material Proxies
- VTF (Valve Texture Files)
- VMT (Valve Materials)
- VBSP (Valve Binary Space Partitioning Map Files)
- .txt configs with key-value pairs
- Valve's entity system
```
Even by Titanfall 2's release in 2016, Respawn had not yet finished developing their own proprietary tech stack (known as RTECH, Respawn Tech) and fully implementing it, resorting to using their proprietary tech alongside modified Valve tech, such as RUI (Respawn UI) alongside VGUI (i.e.: for the Archer Rocket Launcher). Titanfall 2 still used .MDL's.  

It took until Apex Legend's release in 2019 for Respawn to mostly implement RTECH and later on in Apex Legend's life until RTECH had been FULLY implemented.  

- At launch, models were separated into MDL, VTX, VVD and PHY. Later on, they were packed into RMDL's and separate .VG physics data.  
- For the first years of Apex Legends' life, the engine still relied on VPK's, which were eventually phased out completely for RPAK's.  
- The build that R5V uses, Season 3 Apex Legends, supports both VPKs and VMT materials.  
- Animation sequences were separated from the MDL files into RSEQ's (Respawn Animation Sequence files). Rigs were also separated into RRIG's (Respawn Rig Files)  

## 4. Animations in R5 Valkyrie and retail Apex Legends

This leaves us at the present moment, where the current formats are used by Season 3 Apex Legends, which are part of the Respawn's Respawn proprietary tech stack RTECH, whose engineering was spearheaded by former Respawn employee Earl Hammon, after which the in-universe Hammond Corporation was named:

```
Proprietary animation sequence format: RSEQ, 

Proprietary skeletal mesh / rig / armature format: RRIG,

Proprietary model format: RMDL,

Proprietary UI format: RUI,

Proprietary Particle System format: EFCT,

Proprietary asset archive format: RPAK,

Proprietary DirectX Shader format (unnamed, but known as "MSW" / Multi-Shader Wrapper, created by R5 Reloaded creator and software engineer Kawe Mazidjatari / Amos)
```

All are binary files, meaning they cannot be opened as plaintext; they require hexadecimal editing or reverse engineering of their headers and structures for proper inspection, modification and repacking.  
However, in Season 3, these are used in tandem with VPKs (maps, certain models, etc.), VMTs (some world materials, particle effect materials, etc.) and, still, VGUI and BSP.  

Models have rigs and animation seqeuences associated as dependencies (defined inside RePak / RSX exported assets inside rigs: [], seqs: [], contained within RSON plaintext files)  
Rigs have animation sequences associated as dependencies (defined inside RePak / RSX exported assets inside seqs: [], contained within RSON plaintext files)  


## 5. Animation Activities and Animation Activity Modifiers

Animation Activities represent indirected names for a collection of related animations (group aliases). They can be thought of as sets of related animations which are grouped under a common alias, such as first person reload animations being grouped under the "ACT_VM_RELOAD" viewmodel activity (VM, in this context, refers to viewmodel, not virtual machine).

Activities in the Source engine are defined inside activitylist.h and which activities are used for which animations is defined models' .qc files, pre-compile.

Activities also have associated weights which can be arbitrarily defined (1, 100, 2000, etc.). These weights control the likelihood that a certain individual animation will play when an activity is triggered and are calculated using the formula individual_weight / sum_of_weights

Animation Activity Modifiers act similarly to code flags, signalling that specific animations are supposed to play for an activity, depending on in-game contexts (such as Legend-specific animations, like Rampart's LMG animations). Essentially, they "modify activities" (offering additional context to the engine), as the name implies.

Activities are listed in (and in the future will be registered in) platform/script/activity_types.txt and in the R5SDK in shared_activities.h / ai_activity.h (traditionally in Source Engine games):
```
// custom activity (inspect being one of them)

  	ACT_VM_CHARGE = 472,
	ACT_VM_CHARGE_VER1 = 473,
	ACT_VM_CHARGE_VER2 = 474,
	ACT_VM_CHARGE_VER3 = 475,
	ACT_VM_CHARGE_VER4 = 476,
	ACT_VM_CHARGE_LEVEL_INCREASE = 477,

R5V is developing a solution for registering custom activities and activity modifiers in the engine.  

Commands exist for dumping all activities and activity modifiers to the console:  

activity_dump  

activitymodifier_dump  




## 6. Animation Activity Methods
```
weapon.StartCustomActivity(string activityName, 0)
weapon.StopCustomActivity()
```

## 7. Animation Events

Animation Events represent flags inside of the animations that convey that an event has happened to the engine. They can be included inside $sequence commands inside model or animation-only .qc files, in which case they are named in ALL-CAPS, use underscores, use the "AE_" prefix, the "event" keyword, mention the frame number that the Animation Event is signalled at in the animation, have one context dependent parameter, and are contained between two curly brackets { }

This is the Animation Event structure inside $sequence containers, in .qc files:
```
$sequence "sequencename" {
// sequence commands    
{ event AE_ANIMATION_EVENT framenumber context_dependent_param }
// sequence commands
}

Examples:

{ event AE_WPN_READYTOFIRE 10 "" }
{ event AE_CL_PLAYSOUND 0 "weapon_rampage_equip" }

```

List of Animation Events used in R5V / Apex Legends:  

### Weapon Animation Events
```
AE_WPN_READYTOFIRE // 3rd parameter ""
AE_WPN_RUMBLE // controller haptic feedback, 3rd parameter string rumbleParameters
AE_WPN_RELOAD_MILESTONE_1 // segmented reload milestone, 3rd parameter ""
AE_WPN_RELOAD_MILESTONE_2 // segmented reload milestone, 3rd parameter ""
AE_WPN_FILLAMMO // ammo refill callback, 3rd parameter ""
```
### Audio Animation Events
```
CL = Client-side

AE_CL_PLAYSOUND // 3rd parameter string audioEventName, i.e.: "weapon_rampage_reload_maginsert"
AE_CL_STOPSOUND // 3rd parameter string audioEventName
```

### Bodygroup Animation Events
```
AE_ENABLE_BODYGROUP // 3rd parameter string bodygroupName, i.e.: "thermite"
AE_DISABLE_BODYGROUP // 3rd parameter string bodygroupName, i.e.: "thermite"
AE_WPN_CLIPBODYGROUP_SHOW // 3rd parameter ""
AE_WPN_CLIPBODYGROUP_HIDE // 3rd parameter ""
```
### Script Callback Animation Events
```
CL = Client-side
SV = Server-side

AE_CL_VSCRIPT_CALLBACK  // 3rd parameter script callback name

AE_SV_VSCRIPT_CALLBACK // 3rd parameter script callback name

{ event AE_SV_VSCRIPT_CALLBACK 120 "dragon_lmg_energized" }
{ event AE_CL_VSCRIPT_CALLBACK 0 "muzzle_flash" }
{ event AE_CL_VSCRIPT_CALLBACK 0 "shell_eject" }
{ event AE_CL_VSCRIPT_CALLBACK 0 "ammo_update" }
```

### Player Movement State Animation Events
```
{ event AE_GROUND_CONTACT_L 0 "LandSweetener_High" }

```

### Particle System Animation Events
```
{ event AE_CL_CREATE_PARTICLE_EFFECT 9 "P_wpn_nem_reload_cyl_elec_01 follow_attachment fx_mag_inneredge_01" } 
{ event AE_CL_ADD_PARTICLE_EFFECT_CP 9 "P_wpn_nem_reload_cyl_elec_01 1 follow_attachment fx_frame_edge_01" } // I don't know the difference for sure, don't ask me
{ event AE_CL_STOP_PARTICLE_EFFECT 53 "P_wpn_nem_reload_cyl_elec_01 follow_attachment fx_mag_inneredge_01" }


// 3rd parameter contains:
a) The first person particle effect
b) The particle effect behavior
c) The particle effect attachment point on the model

```

## 8. Script-based Animation Events 

There is an alternative to .qc Animation Events, which is the use of script-based Animation Events.
```
Examples:

AddGlobalAnimEvent("cloak_on", AnimEvent_Cloak_On)

AddAnimEvent( entity ent, string animEventName, funcref() callbackFunction )
AddAnimEvent( pistol, "muzzle_flash", muzzleFlashCallback )
AddAnimEvent( npc, "dropship_warpout, WarpoutEffect )
AddAnimEvent( firstPersonProxy, "mantle_smallmantle", OnSmallMantle )
AddAnimEvent( firstpersonProxy, "mantle_mediummantle", OnMediumMantle )
AddAnimEvent( firstPersonProxy, "mantle_lowmantle", OnLowMantle )
DeleteAnimEvent( entity ent, string eventName )


AddGlobalAnimEventTokenize( string animEventName, funcref() callbackFunction )
AddAnimEventTokenized()
DeleteAnimEventTokenized()


AddAnimAlias( "atlas", "ptpov_rodeo_move_front_lower_entrance", "ptpov_rodeo_move_atlas_back_mid_entrance") // for reusing animations on multiple models


GetOptionalAnimEventVar()


MakeAnimEventData()
AnimEventData animEventData = GetAnimEventDataForEvent( entity ent, string eventName )


AnimEvent_attach_pistol_common( ent, STEAL_PISTOL_MODEL, "w_p2011_mp_execution_gun_steal", StealP2011MuzzleFlash)

## 9. Animation Event Functions

```
CodeCallback_OnServerAnimEvent( entity ent, string eventName )
CodeCallback_HandleClientAnimEvent()
HasAnimEvent( entity ent, string eventName )
HasAnimEventTokenized( entity ent, string eventName )
RunAnimEventCallbacks( entity ent, string eventName )
PlayDialogueForAnimEvent( entity ent, string token)
```

## 10. Global Animation Event Structures
```
global struct AnimEventData
global struct TokenizedAnimEventData
```

## 11. Animation Event Entity Keyvalues
```
entity.e.tokenizedAnimEventDataForEntity[ eventName ] <- animEventData // animEventData is an instance of the AnimEventData structure, this is a newslotting command, which creates a new slot in the Anim Event Data Table

delete entity.e.tokenizedAnimEventDataForEntity[ eventName ] // this is a slot deletion command

entity.e.animEventDataForEntity[ eventName ]
```

## 12. Script Callback Functions For Animation Events Inside .txt Config Files
```
"OnClientAnimEvent"                 "OnClientAnimEvent_weapon_Car" // example callback from mp_weapon_car.txt
"OnWeaponTossReleaseAnimEvent"      "Grenade_OnWeaponTossReleaseAnimEvent" // example callback
"OnWeaponPrimaryAttackAnimEvent"
```

## 13. Animation Methods and Functions

It is important to keep in mind that animations are mostly a CLIENT-SIDED cosmetic feature; if you are calling an animation-related function from the SERVER VM and it doesn't work, it is almost certainly a CLIENT VM exclusive function.  

### Animation Callback Functions

All of these functions are global and shared between the SERVER and CLIENT VM's.

```
ClientCodeCallback_AnimWindowStart( ScriptAnimWindow window )
ClientCodeCallback_AnimWindowTransition( ScriptAnimWindow window )
ClientCodeCallback_AnimWindowStop( ScriptAnimWindow window )
ClientCodeCallback_AnimWindowPrecache( asset windowSettingsAsset )

CodeCallback_AnimationDone( entity ent )
CodeCallback_AnimationInterrupted( entity ent )
```

### Other Animation Functions

```
PlayAnimTeleport( entity, animation_name, reference = null, optionalTag = null, initialTime = -1.0, smooth = false )

## 14. How Animations Work With Multiple Entities

For first person animations:

Firstly, the same rig / skeleton is applied to the weapon viewmodel and the first person arms model. Where associated vertex groups are found in the model's 3D mesh (collection of triangles / polygons), the bone names must be identical to the vertex group names in order to control that part of the model. The models can't and don't need to have the same vertex groups (a first person arms model won't have a weapon model, for example) and this, by design, won't result in errors. The vertex groups that do not exist on one model are simply skipped and not animated. Different rigs are NOT compatible and CANNOT be used simultaneously.  

Vertex groups and attachment points can be seen either in the model's .qc / .SMD's (usually multiple .SMDs because multiple LoD's / Levels of Detail depending on distance, the farther away from the camera, the less detailed, the lower the poly count, and vice-versa for close distances) or by opening the .MDL / .RMDL with the appropriate Binary Template, inside a hexadecimal editor like 010 Editor. The same goes for bones, joints, and pose parameters, with .RRIG files.  

Secondly, the same animation is played on the identical rig applied to both models, synchronizing them.  

Third person animations work analogously, with worldmodels instead of viewmodels.  


## 15. Animation .QC Commands

It is crucial to know what .QC Commands there are in order to work with animations.  

An exhausitve list of QC Commands can be found on the Valve Developer Wiki [here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:QC_commands) and [here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/QC_Commands).  

However, the most commonly used animation-related .QC Commands in R5V / Apex Legends are (optional parameters are placed in between square brackets; parameters in between round brackets are MANDATORY):  


$animation (name) (file) [optional params]  
Defines an animation alongside with an alias to be used in the .QC file. The framerate can be included as an optional parameter, otherwise it is assumed to be 30 FPS.  
Animations MUST be defined prior to being used in $sequence containers, in the $sequence mode that is used in R5V / Apex Legends (the second mode)!  

$poseparameter (name) (minBoundary) (maxBoundary) ["loop" (number)] ["wrap"]  
Used to define a pose parameter; boundaries are explicitly mentioned and arbitray, i.e.: 0 1 (blending between 2 stages), -180 180, etc.  
Loops are used for animations that loop back in on themselves, such as wheels or propellers turning 360 degrees and looping back in on their start position.  
Used to achieve smooth interpolation between different frames / states for bones on a model.  

A comprehensive tutorial on PoseParameters can be seen here on YouTube, courtesy of Mr Funreal: https://youtu.be/1fMJHD2-n24  

$blend  
Create smooth interpolation between different frames for bones on a model, generally used together with a pose parameter.  
Example: blend POSEPARAM_3 0 1 // This interpolates between the boundary frames, mapped between the values 0 and 1, where 0 is the first frame and 1 is the last frame. Hence, 0.5 would be the frame located halfway in the animation.  
Used to achieve smooth interpolation between different frames / states for bones on a model.  

$sequence   
Defines an animation sequence, which contains multiple animations and can contain many additional parameters, such as blending parameters, layered animations, animation activities, animation events, etc.  
Has two modes:  

```
Mode 1:
$sequence (name) (skeletal animation SMD / DMX) (simple options) {
    (advanced options)
    (events)
    (simple options)

    // Note: the order must be respected
}

Mode 2:
$sequence (name) (simple options) {
    (animation name(s), aliases MUST be defined earlier in the .QC)
    (advanced options)
    (events)
    (simple options)

    // Note: the order must be respected
}
```

This latter $sequence mode is the one used in R5V / Apex Legends.  

An article detailing the many aspects of the $sequence command can be found on the Valve Developer Wiki: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/$sequence  

Commonly used sequence commands (non-exhaustive list, for an exhaustive list, consult the Valve Developer Wiki Article):  

delta  
Communicates to the engine that the $animations referenced in the current sequence have been subtracted. The $sequence will play on top of the currently playing $sequences and NOT override them.  

subtract (string animation) (int frameNumber)  
"This [command] subtracts the specified frame of the specified animation from all the frames of the current animation and creates an animation that is the differences between the two, effectively converting the animation to just be the changes from a reference frame of another animation." (from the Valve Developer Wiki).  

addlayer (string otherSequenceName)  
Adds a layered animation sequence on top of a core animation sequence.  
Usually used to layer delta animations on top of the core animation sequence.  
The animation sequences begin and end together. If the two animations don't have the same individual run time (frames * FPS), framerates will be adjusted for the added layers.  

blendlayer (string sequence) (int startFrame) (int peakFrame) (int tailFrame) (int endFrame) [spline] [crossfade]  
Similar to addlayer, composits the layered animation only over the specified frames.   
The optional spline parameter converts the linear fade in (startFrame -> peakFrame) and the linear fade out (tailFrame -> endFrame) to a spline curve.  

blend (string name) (float minBoundary) (float maxBoundary)  

blendwidth (int width)  

activity (string name) (float weight)  
Defines an Animation Activity for the $sequence.  

activitymodifier (string modifier)  
Defines one or more Animation Activity Modifiers for the $sequence.  

{ event AE_ANIMATION_EVENT_NAME framenumber context_dependent_parameter }  
Defines an Animation Event inside the $sequence  

fps (float framesPerSecond)  
Overrides the framerate of the animation. If not mentioned explicitly, assumed to be 30, by default.  


## 16. Animation Pose Parameter Methods
```
weapon.GetScriptPoseParam0() // the integer returned will be a number between the minimum and maximum frame boundaries established with the .QC command $poseparameter
weapon.SetScriptPoseParam0( int blend ) // this integer must be a number between the minimum and maximum frame boundaries established with the .QC command $poseparameter
```



Apex Legends animations are made at 30 FPS (and then interpolated to 60 FPS?)

default fade in, fade out at 0.2s (200 ms)

using nodes for transitions



animation only .mdls 

you can recompile animations without recompiling the model as well


1) export as smd -> compile to mdl v49 with studiomdl -> convert to mdl v54 with rmdlconv

2) import from a different format into blender -> export as smd -> method 1

3) export rmdl, rrig and rseqs -> use R5-AnimInspector to get .qc -> modify .qc -> recompile animations (and optionally the model) 

.qci (qc inherited) -> look up qci for the discussion on the R5V discord server

4) convert from a higher version of mdl to mdl v54 with r5-animconv
